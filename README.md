# South Wales Pottery Club

## UX - Strategy 
### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a user-centric website for an up and coming pottery class business in South Wales.

The business has not yet begun trading so at this time they are looking to establish an online presence ahead of their launch. The project aims to identify the potential market for pottery classes by evaluating similar businesses and researching customer needs. 

The outcome of this project will target consumers appropriately and add value to their experience by utilising UX design principles. The site will be cleanly presented, easy to navigate and encourage enquires through clickable links. The user will also have easy access to all relevant information wihtout having to search through multiple pages. 

### Business Goals

* To attract customers and build membership

### Competitor Review

#### Cardiff Pottery Workshops 

 [Cardiff Pottery Workshops](https://www.cardiffpotteryworkshops.com) are a successful business based in Cardiff. They have  wide range of classes and membership options available including lessons, studio space for rent and social evenings.
 
  Although very informative, the website is not the most intuitive and seems to lack responsiveness when viewed on a larger screen. There is a lot of empty space when you first navigate to the home page and the menu sits in the middle of the screen, it not immediately obvious that there is more content on the page. The navigation menu is a long list of things they offer in no particular order which may cause issues with users not being able to find the appropriate content quickly. 

 Further down, they have links to different pages within the about section. These link to new pages with class descriptions, however on testing a number of the links don't work. Presenting the class descriptions in this way makes it quite challenging for the user, as it relies on them scrolling down to the appropriate section, reading the about section where you would not intuituvely look for class information, and then unable to find the information with broken links. 

The contact page doesn't respond to being on a larger screen, while not unusable it doesn't create the best UX experience as the input boxes seem disproportionately large for the amount of content they are designed to contain.

Lastly, the booking system is quite sporadic. Rather than having a dedicated booking section they have hidden the booking forms within the individual class pages. The personal tuition is at the bottom of the throwing classes page, which would not be where a user is likely to look for it.

While the site is comprehensive and contains a lot of useful information, it could be made more user friendly by better organising the information into relevant categories. Having a dedicated classes and booking page would rectify some of the navigation problems, while addressing some of the responsiveness issues would improve the user experience.

#### Peggy's Pots

[Peggy's Pots](https://www.peggyspots.co.uk/Default.aspx) is another successful business based in Cardiff. They offer pottery painting experiences and parties for people of all ages, especially catering for families.

The website is easier to navigate than the Cardiff Pottery Workshop but could also be improved upon. The navigation menu again is quite a long list that could be better organised into categories and sits below the logo.

They have included a classes section on the home page, providing a clear overview of the different class types. Clicking on these leads to a dedicated class page with descriptions and what to expect. Further down they have testimonials, the subscribe form and address all sitting within the footer. There seems to be an issue with the form size making a lot of empty space next to it. The form could perhaps be moved to another section to avoid this. 

The site has been designed with Bootstrap so seems to avoid any issues with resizing, and in fact looks better on a smaller screen as there is less blank space. The contact and booking pages contain lots of useful information, but could potenially benefit from some adjustments to the layout as the containers seem to sit randomly across the screen on a larger screen. Overall it is a good basic site which in relatively easy to navigate, however it could be made more user friendly with some tweaking to the design and layout.
